## Assumptions Made in Original README

In the original README, it was assumed that the people with access to the project would be team members in the training course and the tutor who is assessing the work done.
It was assumed that no one outside of the training program classroom would access the files and that no further context for the files and their purpose was needed to be given.

## How the Updated README Improves Onboarding

The updated README gives an overview on the project and it's use cases.
It provides information of how people may contribute to the project, what documentation currently exists within the project files, as well as what files can be expected to be added in the future of the project. 
The new README is well structured and easy to navigate with short, but descriptive headings with relevant information.

## Lessons Learned on Communicating Through Pull Requests and Issues

I have learned that Pull Requests make it possible for collaborators to work on one repository and make changes to files and then push the changes to the owner of the repository so that they may review the changes that were made to the files, comment of the work that was done, and finally approve or deny the request to pull the changes into the main branch.
