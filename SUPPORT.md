# User Support, Issue Reporting and Feature Request Guide

If you find that you are having some sort of difficulty with the project files, have found a new bug in the system or would like to request a new feature to be added to the project, follow this guide on the format in which to do so as well as where to do it.

## How to Report Issues

Before attempting to report an issue, please refer to the [README file]("C:\Users\Training Center 1\Emily\ConferenceRoomBookingSystem\README.md") and to the common issues paragraph to see if the issue has already been noted. This prevents the developer from being overwhelmed by the same issue reports to view new ones more easily.

If you have found a bug and would like to kindly inform the developer(s) of it:

 1) Contact [The Developer](emilycKellerman@gmail.com)
 2) Please title your email with "Issue Report: Conference Booking System"
 3) In the body of your email, provide a structured and descriptive report on the issues you have encountered.
 4) Provide clearly labeled visual guides (screenshots and screen recordings) as to what the issue is if possible.
 5) Indicate whether the problem can be replicated or not

 ## How to Request Features

 If you have used the Conference Booking System and find that the lack of a certain feature severely impacts the quality of the system as a whole, or would like to request a quality-of-life feature to be implemented:
 1) Contact [The Developer](emilycKellerman@gmail.com)
 2) Please title your eamil with "Feature Request: Conference Booking System"
 3) In the body of your email, provide a structured description on the feature you would like to implement and examples on how the feature would be used
 4) Indicate whether it is quality-of-life or neccessary functionality and quality of the system
