## Stakeholder Feedback
- Positive feedback: Working on tasks independent from one another simultaneously was advantageous
- Concerns or questions: There is a worry that the team took on too much work per work week and that they might burn out. There needs to be a deeper understanding on Acceptance criteria of a task and how sub tasks add to it
- Requests or adjustments: The tasks should be broken down into smaller pieces so that the team does not burn out and so that effort is spread evenly among tasks
