## Self Evaluation on Presentation

### Clarity of explanation

- I think that I was quite clear on my explanation, maybe I skimmed over some of the details for the sake of time, however I think the message was delivered clearly to the intended audience

---

### Technical accuracy

- I made sure to use the correct technical jargon when addressing a more technical audience
- I avoided complicated language for the non-technical audience
- I was specific when referring to technical components of the project
- I could have gone into more detail about which parts of the software will be used and explained the technical skills needed

---

### Structure and flow

- The structure of my presentation, aided by the assignment instructions, was solid and had good flow from one topic to the next
- The topics were clear in indicating who the audience for the topic was
- The slides have a cohesive design and are easy to follow

---

### Confidence in delivery

- I was very confident in my delivery, because I believe I have a solid understanding of the work we have done for this assignment, and I understand how different audiences require different methods to deliver information due to skill barriers.
- I could have slowed down and taken more time to better annunciate my words and could have taken a second to breath as to not have my words stumble over one another

### What you would improve next time

- I will slow down my speech
- I will linger longer on important details and take time to make sure I am communicating their importance clearly
- I will make eye contact with more of the members listening to gauge how understandable I am coming across
