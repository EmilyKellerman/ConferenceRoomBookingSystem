## Presentation Notes

### Slide 1: Title

- Greetings to all, clients, stakeholders and developers

- this is a short presentation on the developer onboarding process

---

### Slide 2: Agenda

- The agenda is as follows:

- Targeted at the clients - Giving system context, describing the workflow

- Targeted at developers - describing the technical components, explaining the pull request and collaboration flow

- targeted at all collaborators - the importance of project documentation, common pitfalls and contracts

- Finally a demo of the current documentation

---

### Slide 3: System Context:

- This Conference room booking system is designed for employees so that they may view a list of available rooms.

- Employees will be able to book a room for use, or cancel an existing booking (given that they are the one who booked the room)

- Administrators will have access to an administrator dashboard so that they can solve unforeseen booking conflicts

- Facility managers will also be able to book a room for maintenance, which may override an existing booking

---

### Slide 4: High Level Workflow

- As a team, we will make use of the scheduling assistant Asana.

- This allows us to view task deadlines as well as who the tasks are assigned to

- There is 2 teams involved: The frontend team responsible for designing the user UI and making all of the features user-friendly, and the backend developer, responsible for implementing authentication as well as business logic into the application

- The teams will work using a contacted list of all features expected in the final product

---

### Slide 5: Key Technical Components

- For the developers, the important technical components we use include:

    1) Git for version control

    2) API endpoints written in Swagger for an instruction list of required features and their respective paramaters

    3) Postman to validate our API endpoints and test the requests

    4) Docker to standardize the .NET version used to run the project

---

### Slide 6: Pull Requests/Collaboration Flow

- When collaborating, developers will make use of Pull requests with a structure specified in the existing project documentation

- The Product Owner will have the base version and therefore the main branch 

- Team members will work on sub-branches and make a pull request

- Once the changes or additions have been reviewed and approved, they will be merged into the main branch for permanent addition

---

### Slide 7: Documentation & Contracts

- The development team will rely on extensive documentation to keep everyone on the same page, as well as to make the onboarding process seamless

- Important documents to make sure are consistently updated and easily accessible include:

    1) README.md

    2) API endpoint documentation and contracts

- The software that will be used include:

    1) VS Code

    2) Swagger

    3) Postman

---

### Slide 8: Common Pitfalls and Risks

- The risks to this project include:

    1) The team being assigned an unrealistic amount of work to do in a short period of time. This can lead to burnout and less productivity

    2) Lack of frequent communication between members, leading to a possible delay in the project

- Some pitfalls to avoid include:

    1) Making sure developers communicate any blockers so that there aren't any unnecessary delays

    2) Avoiding obstacles that the team manager cannot remove and therefore put a roadblock in the development process

---

### Slide 9: Demo Overview

- The Demo I would like to do includes a brief tour of the swagger documentation and how we use postman to test and validate the endpoints created

---

### Slide 10: Summary and Resources

- In conclusion, documentation of the project is the biggest priority in the onboarding process

- API endpoints and the README documentation is very useful in keeping members on the same page

- My sources include:
    1) The assignment instruction document serving as a template for this presentation
    2) Skye for teaching the skills to document project artefacts as well as providing resources to excell
    3) My GitHub repository with all the documentation i have mentioned in this presentation
