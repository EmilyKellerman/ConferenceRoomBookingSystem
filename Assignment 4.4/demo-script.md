## Demonstration Script for presentation

### Swagger 

- Open the file in my repository "api-documentation.yml" using swagger, quickly demonstrating how each request is automatically rendered on the right side of the screen.
- This is a useful tool acting as an agreement between the front and back end developers as to what is expected at the end of the project, so that they do not have to work side by side in order to progress
- Work can be done separately and then the teams can integrate their work into one cohesive project

### Postman

- Open Postman and import the swagger file into a new collection, demonstrating how all the requests are automatically created and can be tested against a server to see example responses from requests
