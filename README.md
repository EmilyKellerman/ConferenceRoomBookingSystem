# 🏢 Conference Room Booking System

This repository contains a project with documentation of simulated sprints and preparation for a Conference Room Booking System.

This system will allow employees to search a list of available rooms, filtering by a provided capacity if needed, and book a room for use.
There will be an administrator login portal giving them access to the administrator dashboard.
There will also be functionality for a receptionist to book on behalf of another person and for facility managers to book a room for maintenance.

The project simulates a **Conference Room Booking System** that will be expanded over multiple modules to support learning around documentation, APIs, teamwork, and system handover.

## 💪 Developer Onboarding Guide

 - This project is developed incrementally for a Software training program
 - The project will have additions made to it daily through assignents and will slowly build up to being a functional booking system for employees
 - Documentation is organised with a pre-determined file structure, that will have files added and/or edited according to the work that is done
 - Project artefacts can be found in the project folders. So far the artefacts available are:

    1) Sprint 1 checkpoint, dailies, planning, retrospective, review and summary
    2) Pull Request Template

 - Technologies used so far and are planned to be used:

    1) VS Code as a file editior
    2) VS Code as a git terminal
    3) GitHub for repository storage
    4) GitHub for allowance of team collaboration
    5) Asana for sprint and project planning
