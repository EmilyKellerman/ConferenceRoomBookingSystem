## 💪 Developer Onboarding Guide

 - This project is developed incrementally for a Software training program
 - The project will have additions made to it daily through assignents and will slowly build up to being a functional booking system for employees
 - Documentation is organised with a pre-determined file structure, that will have files added and/or edited according to the work that is done
 - Project artefacts can be found in the project folders. So far the artefacts available are:

    1) Sprint 1 checkpoint, dailies, planning, retrospective, review and summary
    2) Pull Request Template

 - Technologies used so far and are planned to be used:

    1) VS Code as a file editior
    2) VS Code as a git terminal
    3) GitHub for repository storage
    4) GitHub for allowance of team collaboration
    5) Asana for sprint and project planning
